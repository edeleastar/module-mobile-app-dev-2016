Gradle will start downloading required dependencies.  When this is finished, you should have the following project structure:

Note that all of our Kotlin files will be kept in a kotlin directory and, likewise, the Java files will be kept in the Java directory.

## Kotlin `main` Function

Similar to previous labs, create a new package `org.wit.placemark` inside the `Kotlin` folder and add a new `File` called **main** inside that package

Enter the following code into this new `main` file:

~~~java
fun main(args: Array<String>){
    println("Placemark Kotlin App Version 1.0")
}
~~~

Your project should now look something like this

Now Run/Play the app.

You should have the following output:

Save your work.
