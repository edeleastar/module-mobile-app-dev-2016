You may have noticed (and if you haven't, test for it now) that when you navigate back to your **Donate** Screen from your **Report Screen** that the progress bar and total have been reset back to zero.

This obviously, should not be the case, so see if you can fix that.

As a starting point, you'll probably need to override the **onResume** method of the Donate Activity.

Also ArrayLists have a very useful function **sumBy()** with it's usage as follows

~~~
aTotalSumAmount = mylist.sumBy { it.amount }
~~~

where **amount** is a property of the objects stored in the list, so see if you can complete this exercise.
