# Placemark-Console 4.0 - Placemark Persistence

Currently our placemarks are transient - when the app is closed the placemarks are lost. We would like to make them persistent so that they are retained between app launches.

There are many strategies for implementing persistence - both local and remote (cloud) but we'll start with one of the simplest - storing the placemarks in a basic file.

## FileHelpers

To keep our file access simple, we introduce some general purpose file helper functions so first create a new package (at the same level as the previous packages) called `helpers`, a new **file** `FileHelpers` and replace it with the following:

~~~kotlin
package org.wit.placemark.console.helpers

import mu.KotlinLogging
import java.io.*

val logger = KotlinLogging.logger {}

fun write( fileName: String, data: String) {

    val file = File(fileName)
    try {
        val outputStreamWriter = OutputStreamWriter(FileOutputStream(file))
        outputStreamWriter.write(data)
        outputStreamWriter.close()
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        logger.error { "Cannot read file: " + e.toString() }
    }
}

fun read(fileName: String): String {
    val file = File(fileName)
    var str = ""
    try {
        val inputStreamReader = InputStreamReader(FileInputStream(file))
        if (inputStreamReader != null) {
            val bufferedReader = BufferedReader(inputStreamReader)
            val partialStr = StringBuilder()
            var done = false
            while (!done) {
                var line = bufferedReader.readLine()
                done = (line == null);
                if (line != null) partialStr.append(line);
            }
            inputStreamReader.close()
            str = partialStr.toString()
        }
    } catch (e: FileNotFoundException) {
        logger.error { "Cannot Find file: " + e.toString() }
    } catch (e: IOException) {
        logger.error { "Cannot Read file: " + e.toString() }
    }
    return str
}

fun exists(fileName: String): Boolean {
    val file = File(fileName)
    return file.exists()
}
~~~

These functions are using the standard java.io streams facilities which demonstrates the ability to mix and match Kotlin and Java classes.
