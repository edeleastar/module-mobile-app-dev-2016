# Exercises

## Exercise 1: Switching Stores
Change back to using the PlacemarkMemStore instead of PlacemarkJSONStore. The only change you need to make should be in `PlacemarkController`.

Try some experiments to make sure the persistence is working as expected:

Using `MemStore` - create some placemarks and then kill the app. Relaunch, and verify that all placemarks are gone

Using `JsonStore` - try the same experiment. This time the placemarks should persist between application terminations.

## Exercise 2
Currently we have no way of deleting placemarks. To support delete, you will need to extend the `PlacemarkStore` to support removal of placemarks, and then implement this in `PlacemarkMemStore` and `PlacemarkJSONStore`

These are the implementations you will need:

**PlacemarkStore**
~~~kotlin
  fun delete(placemark: PlacemarkModel)
~~~
Introduce this to `PlacemarkStore` now - and write implementations in `PlacemarkMemStore` and `PlacemarkJSONStore` classes :

**PlacemarkMemStore**
~~~kotlin
  override fun delete(placemark: PlacemarkModel) {
    placemarks.remove(placemark)
  }
~~~

**PlacemaekJSONStore**
~~~kotlin
  override fun delete(placemark: PlacemarkModel) {
    placemarks.remove(placemark)
    serialize()
  }
~~~
To trigger the deletion introduce a new **delete** option in the menu like so

and add the following to `PlacemarkController` to actually delete the placemark from the list (or file)

~~~kotlin
fun delete() {
        placemarkView.listPlacemarks(placemarks)
        var searchId = placemarkView.getId()
        val aPlacemark = search(searchId)

        if(aPlacemark != null) {
            placemarks.delete(aPlacemark)
            println("Placemark Deleted...")
            placemarkView.listPlacemarks(placemarks)
        }
        else
            println("Placemark Not Deleted...")
    }
~~~


## Optional Exercise :)

Before you decide to delve into the world of Android Development, download the following and run this [TornadoFX](http://tornadofx.io) version of Placemark - [placemark-console](archives/placemark-console.zip) it demonstrates Kotlin can also be used for a range of UI based applications, not just mobile :)

**NOTE** - You'll need to have the **TornadoFX** Plugin installed for IntelliJ:

![](img/03.png)

and the following dependency

~~~kotlin
implementation 'no.tornado:tornadofx:1.7.18'
~~~


The existing json file has the folowing 'records'

![placemark.json](img/04.png)

And when you launch the application you should get something like this

![Main Menu](img/05.png)

and

![Adding a Placemark](img/06.png)

and finally

![Listing All Placemarks](img/07.png)

You can find links to all the versions of **Placemark-Console** [here](https://github.com/ddrohan/placemark-console/releases)
