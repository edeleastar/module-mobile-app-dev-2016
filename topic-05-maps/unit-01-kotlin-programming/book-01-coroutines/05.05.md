# Putting it All Together

At this point, you’ve created all the necessary code, so you’re ready to put all the pieces together and create some Kotlin Coroutines. You’ll see how they make creating asynchronous operations easy.

First, inside your **onViewCreated()** (inside your Fragment) place the following:

~~~kotlin
coroutineScope.launch(Dispatchers.Main) {
  val originalBitmap = getOriginalBitmapAsync(tutorial).await()
}
~~~

In this code snippet, you launch a coroutine on the main thread. But the **originalBitmap** is computed in a worker thread pool, so it doesn’t freeze the UI. Once you call **await()**, it will suspend **launch()**, until the image value is returned.

Now, you need to call a method to apply the snow filter on the image, then load the final image.

To do it, create **loadImage()**, outside this code, as follows:

~~~kotlin
private fun loadImage(snowFilterBitmap: Bitmap){
  progressBar.visibility = View.GONE
  snowFilterImage?.setImageBitmap(snowFilterBitmap)
}
~~~

By calling up **loadSnowFilterAsync()** to get the filtered Bitmap and loading it into the Image view, you’ll get:

~~~kotlin
coroutineScope.launch(Dispatchers.Main) {
  val originalBitmap = getOriginalBitmapAsync(tutorial).await()
  //1
  val snowFilterBitmap = loadSnowFilterAsync(originalBitmap).await()
  //2
  loadImage(snowFilterBitmap)
}
~~~

You’re simply applying the filter to a loaded image, and then passing it to **loadImage()**. That’s the beauty of coroutines: they help convert your async operations into natural, sequential, method calls.

If when you run the app, the image overlaps the description, just tweak the **snowFilterImage** ImageView like so:

~~~xml
<ImageView
    android:id="@+id/snowFilterImage"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:layout_alignTop="@+id/progressBar"
    android:layout_centerHorizontal="true"
    android:layout_marginTop="140dp"
    tools:src="@mipmap/ic_launcher" />
~~~
