# Testing Concurrency 2

In this step we'll run some couroutines in the background and **NOT** block the main thread.

First, create a new test, **test4** and add the following:

~~~kotlin
GlobalScope.launch {  // launch new coroutine in background and continue

        delay(3000L) // non-blocking delay for 3 seconds (default time unit is ms)
        println("World!") // print after delay
        val sum1 = async { // non blocking sum1
            delay(2000L)
            println("sum1 paused in the background!")
            2 + 2
        }
        val sum2 = async { // non blocking sum2
            delay(1000L)
            println("sum2 paused in the background!")
            3 + 3
        }
        println("waiting for concurrent sums")
        val total = sum1.await() + sum2.await() // execution stops until both sums are calculated
        println("Total is: $total")
    }
    println("Hello,")     // main thread continues while coroutine executes
    Thread.sleep(6000L)   // block main thread for 6 seconds to keep JVM alive
~~~

and fix any import errors - be sure to import the correct **GlobalScope** if prompted

Run the test and pay particular attention to the **order** in which the statements are printed to the console.

You'll get something like this:

As another small experiment, can you work out how long the Thread should sleep for (less than 6 seconds) to get something like this (there's a clue in the output!)

and can you explain why?

In this next test we'll make an actual network call, which would be a very common use-case, and see how our coroutines handle it.

First, add the following dependency

~~~kotlin
implementation "com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.5"
~~~

Open your **utils.kt** and add the following:

~~~kotlin
fun wikipedia(keyword: String): String {
    val url = "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php" +
            "?action=query&format=json&prop=extracts" +
            "&exsectionformat=plain&exsentences=2&explaintext=1" +
            "&titles=$keyword"
    val json = java.net.URL(url).readText()
    val jsonObject = Gson().fromJson<JsonObject>(json, JsonObject::class.java)
    val pages = jsonObject["query"].asJsonObject["pages"].asJsonObject
    val extract = pages[pages.keySet().first()].asJsonObject["extract"]
    return extract.asString
}
~~~

and fix any import errors.

We won't be too concerned about this function at the moment. All we need to know is that it will take a String as a parameter and return the Search results from wikipedia in a json string, which it then formats and returns to the calling program.

Next create another test **test5** and add this:

~~~kotlin
    val keyword = "Ireland"
    GlobalScope.launch {  // launch new coroutine in background and continue
        delay(2000L) // non-blocking delay for 2 seconds (default time unit is ms)
        println("World!") // print after delay
        val wResult = async { wikipedia(keyword) }
        println("Wikipedia replied: ${wResult.await()}")
    }
    println("Hello,")     // main thread continues while coroutine executes
    Thread.sleep(3000L)   // block main thread for 3 seconds to keep JVM alive
~~~

Run the program again and pay particular attention to the order and time the statements are printed to the console.
