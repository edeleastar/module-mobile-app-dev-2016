# Exercises

As a small exercise, see can you reduce even further your `main()` to the following

~~~kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    PlacemarkController().start()
}
~~~

It's not really necessary but does demonstrate the usefulness of Kotlin Objects (and in this instance 'Chaining' functions).

If you have time to spare, try adding more functions and experiment with the constructs we covered in this lab and/or experiment with this kotlin learning resource:
